# Request Info Application #

This is a very simple application that has one JSP page only.  When visiting that page, it will print out all the
request information (headers, HttpServletRequest properties, etc).

I created this as a means to test SSL proxying in Amazon AWS Elastic Beanstalk - I wanted to see what headers
were being set to which values and to see how Amazon's proxying affected request properties based on TLS (SSL)
connections.
